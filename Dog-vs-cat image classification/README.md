🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classifier
This deep learning project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. Trained on the popular Kaggle "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset, the model learns to detect key features like facial structure, ear shape, and fur patterns to accurately distinguish between the two animals.

Key Features:

Built with TensorFlow/Keras

Achieves high accuracy on validation data

Uses data augmentation to improve generalization

Includes early stopping and dropout for better performance

📦 Use Case: Ideal for image recognition tasks, pet identification apps, or as a foundational computer vision project for beginners
